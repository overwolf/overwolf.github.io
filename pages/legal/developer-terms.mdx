   quarter for at least two (2) years after the conclusion of that calendar quarter.

thereof shall be to cease use of the Platform or Platform API. Overwolf may cease
to make the Platform or Platform API available at any time and without notice.

11. **Limitation of Liability.** In no event will Overwolf be liable to you for
any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages
or any loss of or damage to use, data, business, goodwill, or profits arising out
of or in connection with these Terms or the Platform. Insofar as applicable law

notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. Overwolf's
liability arising out of the Platform or the Platform, whether based upon warranty,
contract, tort or otherwise, shall not exceed amounts paid to Overwolf by Developer

12. **Term and Termination.**
    1. **Term.** The term of these Terms shall commence as of the date accepted
    by the Developer and shall continue until terminated pursuant to the provisions
    hereof (such period of time being defined as the "**Term**").

    2. **Termination.** Overwolf may immediately terminate or suspend these Terms,
    any rights granted herein, or your license to the Platform API, at its sole
    discretion at any time, for any reason or no reason at all, with or without
    advance notice. Overwolf may further terminate, suspend, or discontinue the

    for the avoidance of doubt, (a) cease all use of the Platform and Platform
    API, (b) cease all distribution of the Application and (c) ensure that no use

    hereunder with respect to other Applications. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    Overwolf may continue to retain (but not distribute or display) any of your
    Applications or content on its own servers to the extent necessary to ensure
    the continued functionality of the Applications downloaded by End-Users.
    Termination of these Terms shall not affect the obligations of Developer to
    pay Overwolf all amounts owing or to become owing to Overwolf hereunder on
    or before the date of such termination, as well as interest thereon to the
    extent any such amounts are paid after the date they became or will become
    due pursuant to these Terms. Any revenue received after the termination of
    these Terms in respect of or connected to the Application shall continue to
    be shared among the parties according to the provisions hereof.

    relationship with any End-Users as it relates to the use of your Application.

    contract with you or paid you for the use of that Application or your obligations
    thereunder, including delivery and support.

    under these Terms and use of the Platform must be filed within one (1) year

    Overwolf reserves the right, at any time in our sole discretion, to amend or
    replace any part of these Terms and any document referred to herein, or any
    part thereof, at any time. You agree that we may notify you of any updated or
    new Terms by posting notice on Overwolf's website, so that they are accessible
    via a link from the home page or by providing you notice at the email address
    associated with your account. Except as explicitly set forth herein, all such
    changes are effective immediately when we post them, or such later date as may
    be specified in the notice of updated Terms. Your continued use of the Platform
    or any of Overwolf's services after such notice confirms your consent to and
    acceptance of such amendment. The most current version of these Terms will govern
    your use and access of the Platform. If you object to any such changes, your sole
    recourse is to cease accessing or using the Platform. These Terms (and the
    incorporated terms referenced) constitutes the entire and sole agreement and
    understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
    hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous understanding, agreements,
    representations or warranties, whether oral or written, with respect to the
    subject matter. No party shall be deemed to have waived compliance by any other
    party with any provision of these Terms unless such waiver is in writing, and
    the failure of any party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of these
    Terms shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such or any other provision
    and shall not affect the rights of any party thereafter to enforce such provisions
    in accordance with their terms. No waiver of any breach of any provision of these
    Terms shall be deemed the waiver of any subsequent breach thereof or of any other
    provision of these Terms. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held
    invalid or unenforceable in any circumstances by a court of competent jurisdiction,
    such section shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to its terms as possible
    under law, and the remainder of these Terms, and the application of such provision
    in any other circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.
 
    6. **Binding Arbitration & Class Action Waiver.**  
    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES
    WITH OVERWOLF AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM OVERWOLF,
    INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

       1. You agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or
       may arise between you and Overwolf relating in any way to or arising out
       of these Terms or your use of or access to the Platform will be resolved
       in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section (15.6).

       2. You and Overwolf will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal
       negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date the notice of dispute
       is sent. That notice should contain proof of your relationship with Overwolf,
       the nature and legal basis for your or Overwolf's dispute, and an individual
       monetary demand if you or we are seeking such relief. During this period,
       the parties shall use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim or disagreement.
       If the dispute is not resolved within such time period, you agree that any
       and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and
       Overwolf relating in any way to or arising out of these Terms or your use
       of or access to the Platform shall be resolved exclusively through final
       and binding arbitration.

       3. You agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an
       individual basis and individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class
       member in any purported class, representative, or private attorney general
       action whether in arbitration or litigation, and the parties expressly waive
       their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. The arbitrator
       may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief)
       only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
       necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim.
       Any relief awarded cannot affect other Overwolf users.

       4. In all events, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally,
       waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any right it may have
       to a trial by jury of any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms
       or your use of or access to the Platform.

       5. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of
       this paragraph's prohibitions on class, representative, or private attorney
       general actions or proceedings as to any claim, then that claim (and only
       that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and resolved in court,
       subject to your and Overwolf's right to appeal the court's decision. All
       other claims will be arbitrated.

       6. The arbitration shall be held in Tel Aviv, Israel (or at another mutually
       agreed upon location). The Israeli Arbitration Law, 5728-1968 shall govern
       the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.
       The arbitration will be conducted by the Israeli Institute of Commercial
       Arbitration, under their rules and procedures as applicable, including the
       commercial arbitration rules, as modified by this agreement.

       7. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claim or dispute under 
       these Terms and related to your access or use of the Platform must be filed
       within one (1) year from the date of the cause of action. If a claim or dispute
       is not filed within one year, you acknowledge that you shall have waived
       and will be deemed permanently barred from bringing such dispute.

       8. With the exception of any of the provisions in the class action waiver,
       if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate
       is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate
       shall still apply. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable
       law precludes enforcement of this Section's limitations as to a particular remedy,
       then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration
       and may be sought in court.

       9. **Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property**: Notwithstanding the
       parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, Overwolf may
       bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property
       rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights,
       trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).

       10. **30-Day Right to Opt Out of Arbitration**: You have the right to
       opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration clause by sending written
       notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: developers@overwolf.com
       The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Platform,
       whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in
       accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of arbitration,
       Overwolf also will not be bound to arbitrate.

       11. **Judicial Forum for Disputes**: Except as otherwise required by
       applicable law or provided in this Section (15.6), in the event that the
       agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and
       Overwolf agree that any judicial proceeding may only be brought in a court
       of competent jurisdiction in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Israel. Both you and Overwolf
       consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

    7. **Governing Law**.

       1. These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the
       laws of Israel excluding that body of law pertaining to conflict of laws.
       Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought
       exclusively in courts located in Israel and the parties hereby irrevocably
       consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein. You agree that these
       Terms and the rules, restrictions, and policies contained herein, and Overwolf's
       enforcement thereof, are not intended to confer and do not confer any rights
       or remedies on any person other than you and Overwolf.

       2. These Terms and any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out
       of or in connection with them will be governed as stated herein provided
       that this choice of governing law will not deprive you of the protection
       afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement
       by virtue of the laws applicable where you habitually reside. In such cases,
       disputes shall be resolved in the competent civil courts as determined by applicable law.

    8. **Assignment; Successors.** Developer shall not assign any of its rights
    or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Overwolf, and
    any assignments in violation of the foregoing shall be void. Overwolf may
    assign its rights or obligations hereunder.

16. **Contact Us.**
