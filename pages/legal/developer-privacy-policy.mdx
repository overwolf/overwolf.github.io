When we share information with services providers and Partners, we ensure they only
have access to such information that is strictly necessary for us to provide the
Developer Platforms. These parties are required to secure the data they receive
and to use the data for pre-agreed purposes only while ensuring compliance with
all applicable data protection regulations (such service providers may use other
non-personal data for their own benefit).

### 1.7 **DATA RETENTION:**

In general, we retain the Personal Data we collect for as long as it remains necessary
for the purposes set forth above, all under the applicable regulation, or until
you express your preference to optout, where applicable.

Other circumstances in which we will retain your Personal Information for longer
periods of time include:
(i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax,
or accounting requirements, or
(ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of
any complaints or challenges, or
(iii) if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your
Personal Data. Please note that except as required by applicable law, we will not
be obligated to retain your data for any particular period, and we may delete it
for any reason and at any time, without providing you with prior notice if our intention to do so.

### 1.8 **SECURITY MEASURES:**

We work hard to protect the Personal Data we process from unauthorized access,
alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We have implemented physical, technical,
and administrative security measures for the Developer Platforms that comply with
applicable laws and industry, such as encryption using SSL, we minimize the amount
of data that we store on our servers, restricting access to Personal Data to Overwolf employees,
contractors, and agents, etc. as we further explain in our Security Policy.
Note that we cannot be held responsible for unauthorized or unintended access beyond
our control, and we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will
always be able to prevent such access.

Please contact us at: dpo@overwolf.com (or developers@overwolf.com)
if you feel that your privacy was not dealt with properly, in a way that was in breach of our
Privacy Policy, or if you become aware of a third party's attempt to gain unauthorized access
to any of your Personal Data. We will make a reasonable effort to notify you and the
appropriate authorities (if required by applicable law) in the event that we discover
a security incident related to your Personal Data.

### 1.9 **INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER:**

Our data servers in which we host and store the information are located in the
US, EU, UK (including AWS hosting servers). The Company's HQ are based in Israel
in which we may access the information stored on such servers or other systems such
as the Company's ERP, CRM, Salesforce, and other systems. In the event that we
need to transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will take appropriate
measures to ensure that your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection
as required under applicable law. Furthermore, when Personal Data that is collected
within the European Economic Area ("**EEA**") is transferred outside of the EEA
to a country that has not received an adequacy decision from the European Commission,
we will take necessary steps in order to ensure that sufficient safeguards are provided
during the transferring of such Personal Data, in accordance with the provision of
the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union. Thus, we will
obtain contractual commitments or assurances from the data importer to protect
your Personal Information, using contractual protections that EEA and UK regulators
have pre-approved to ensure your data is protected (known as standard contract clauses),
or rely on adequacy decisions issued by the European Commission. Some of these
assurances are well-recognized certification schemes.

### 1.10 **USER RIGHTS**

Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect so that you can make meaningful
choices about how it is used. We allow you to exercise certain choices, rights, and controls
in connection with your information. Depending on your relationship with us, your
jurisdiction and the applicable data protection laws that apply to you, you have
the right to control and request certain limitations or rights to be executed.

### 2.6 **NOTICE TO NEVADA RESIDENTS**

Nevada law allows Nevada residents to opt out of the sale of certain types of
personal information. Subject to several exceptions, Nevada law defines “sale”
to mean the exchange of certain types of personal information for monetary consideration
to another person. We currently do not sell personal information as defined in the Nevada law.
However, if you are a Nevada resident, you still may submit a verified request to
opt out of sales and will record your instructions and incorporate them in the future
if our policy changes. You may send opt-out requests to dpo@overwolf.com or by
submitting a ticket using the following link: https://support.overwolf.com/en/support/tickets/new
