:::warning Deprecation notice
Support for this game has been deprecated, following a lack of usage in Apps.

This page is being kept for historial documentation purposes.
:::

Please read the [overwolf.games.events](/api/live-game-data) documentation page to learn how to use Overwolf game events.

## Sample Apps
* [Football Manager 2021 game events sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/events-sample-app)

## Available Features

* [gep_internal](#gep_internal)

## Game event status

It is highly recommended to communicate errors and warnings to app users. 

Check the current game event status [here](/status/). Alternately, you can easily check that status from your app itself, [using our API](/topics/using-events/how-to-check-events-status-from-app).
