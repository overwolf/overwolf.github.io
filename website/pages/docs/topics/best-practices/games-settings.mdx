## Overview
The Overwolf platform enables users to control each app's permissions separately when it comes to opening windows and auto-launching app features. Users can also disable the in-game overlay for each app or for all apps of a specific game if they prefer it. 

Whenever permissions or overlay settings are changed, Overwolf informs users through notifications and messages - keeping users informed has proven to be important for their overall experience.

## Why do users get this level of control?

* We aim to be unintrusive.
* We aim to inform users clearly about pending changes.
* We want users to have the best tools to optimize their Overwolf gaming experiences to their preferences.

## As a creator, you should:

* Inform users about expected app behavior changes in advance.
* Let users manage how your app works in and out of the game, both on launch and when used.

## How do we get there?

* Improve your on-boarding process and clearly explain how the app will work in-game.
* Build a settings page in which the user can change how the platform, app or game behave in Overwolf.
* Whenever permissions or functionality changes, notify your users.

## Terminology

* **Overwolf Game Settings** – The Games section of Overwolf's client settings.
* **Auto Launch** – An app’s ability to launch itself according to internal logic, once triggered by Overwolf.
* **Auto Launch Permission** – Platform level permission that allows the activation of an app’s logic that triggers auto launch.
* **Permission** – After installing an app, if parts of the overlay aren't enabled, users will get a notification asking for overlay permissions.
* **Dedicated app** – An app which is intended to be used in a specific game, and declared as such in the manifest (for example, LoLwiz for LoL).
* **Multi app** – An app which is intended to be used in a number of supported games, and declared as such in the manifest (for example, Killer Voices).
* **Global app** – An app which is intended to be used in ANY game, and declared as such in the manifest (for example, TeamSpeak).
* **Game Settings API** – The API by which an app may query the status of Overlay and Auto Launch Permission settings per game.
* **Overlay** – The ability to display Overwolf components and apps in-game.

## Overwolf settings explained

* When overlay permissions for a game are disabled, no Overwolf apps or features will be displayed inside this game.
* Apps may, or may not, have an Auto Launch capability.
  * Auto Launch has to be stated in the manifest.
  * Auto Launch Permission per app is the platform’s way to allow or disallow app auto launch in-game.
  * A user may launch the app manually from the dock, desktop or any other way regardless of auto launch permission state.
  * Apps without auto launch capability will not have a permission checkbox at all.

## Using API

* Every app can use the [Game Settings API](/api/settings/games) to query the status of Overwolf's settings PER GAME including:
* **Overlay Settings** – is the overlay enabled or disabled?
   * [getOverlayEnabled()](/api/settings/games#getoverlayenabledgameclassid-callback) 
 
* **Auto Launch Permission** - is autolaunch allowed for this app?
  * [getAutoLaunchEnabled()](/api/settings/games#getautolaunchenabledgameclassid-callback) 
  
 ## Bring more value
 
* Apps should inform its users in the following cases:
  * The Overlay for the supported game is disabled – users will not be able to use the app in-game.
  * Auto Launch Permission is unchecked – app will NOT auto launch when the game begins, but can be manually launched.
  * Additionally – in some apps, manual launch may result in lack of functionality. If this is the case with your app, you should tell users as well.

* In case of a Multi or Global app, it's important to inform users if there are specific games in which these apps or parts of their functionality will not work as expected.

* When informing the users about permission or overlay settings, suggest a solve and call users to action – a link that launches the Game Settings window where users can enable missing permissions can be placed in a prime location, for example.
  *Apps cannot change settings through API by themselves. The user has to act and change these settings.
