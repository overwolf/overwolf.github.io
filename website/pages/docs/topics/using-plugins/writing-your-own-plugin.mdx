It's entirely possible for you to create new plug-ins for your needs, just follow these basic rules:

## 1. Implement the Overwolf interface

Create a .NET class library that implements a public constructor. When you call for overwolf.extensions.current.getExtraObject from Javascript, it will create an instance of your plugin and call on it’s constructor.

* It should be an empty constructor or a constructor that accepts an int variable (specifically, the Win32 window handle for the app window hosting your plugin).
* Your class library can contain multiple classes – however you will need a new “extra-object” entry for each class with a unique name.

## 2. Make your public functions accessible

Any public function, property or event will be accessible to your Javascript code automatically if it's in your class. Global events should look like: `public event Action<object, object> onMyEvent` (where you can pass any number of object parameters).

* Your app will crash if it will try to load a plugin that declares a public event of a different form or which doesn’t pass objects.

## 3. Implement asynchronous functions

Our best practice is to implement asynchronous-only functions that accept a callback function triggered by completion:

```js
public void add(int x, int y, Action<object> callback)
```

:::important
* Overwolf version 116.2 and all later versions will only support 64 bit CPUs, and therefore you’ll be required to compile your .DLL to target the x64 platform.
* It is recommended that plugin DLLs be compiled with the .NET 4.8 framework (using a higher/lower framework version might lead to unexpected behaviors)

We recommend you take a look at the [overwolf-plugin-sample](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugin-sample) or [overwolf-plugins](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugins) entry to get a quick start on developing your own plugins.
