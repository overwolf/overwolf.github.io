 You can use this info when a user reports of slowness or freezing of their computer due to an Overwolf app or due to Overwolf itself.

In case a certain Overwolf app is taking an unusual amount of CPU or Memory you can request that the user disable the app using the developer options (Check facecheck article), then verify if the issue persists while the app is disabled.
