Welcome to the Overwolf Developer Referral Program! This program is designed to reward active App
developers on Overwolf who refer new developers to create Apps using our Platform.
By participating in this program, you have the opportunity to earn a share of the revenue generated by the Apps referred by you.
This documentation provides an overview of the program's terms and the process involved.


## What is the Developer Referral Program?

The Developer Referral Program is an initiative by Overwolf to reward active App developers
who refer new developers to create Apps on our platforms (Native & [ow-electron](https://overwolf.github.io/tools/ow-electron)). As a token of our appreciation,
we offer a 10% share of the revenue generated by the referred app for a duration of 12 months to the referrer.
This program encourages the growth of the Overwolf developer community and fosters collaboration among developers.

## Referral Process

To participate in the Developer Referral Program, follow these steps:


 - Referrer Identification: If you are an existing Overwolf developer who meets the eligibility criteria, you can refer a new developer to the platform.


 - Referee Submission: The new developer (referee) should specify the referrer's full name and email when submitting [their app idea](https://overwolf.github.io/start/getting-started/submit-app-proposal#submit-your-proposal) to Overwolf. This step is essential to ensure that the referral is properly tracked.


## Rules and Eligibility

To maintain the integrity of the program, the following rules and eligibility criteria apply:

- Referee: The referee (new developer) must not have had a live App on Overwolf in the past 12 months.

- Referer: The referrer (existing developer) must meet the following criteria:
  - Have a live App on Overwolf.
  - Be monetizing their App for at least 6 months.
  - Achieve a monthly gross revenue of at least $1,000.

## Reward Distribution

Once the referee's App is approved and starts generating revenue, Overwolf will share 10% of our cut of the revenue with the referrer for a period of 12 months. This reward is a percentage of the revenue generated by the referred App, and it serves as a token of our gratitude for your contribution to the Overwolf developer community.


## Eligibility Period

The eligibility period for the referral program is a maximum of 30 days following the submission of the App to our platform. This means that the referee must specify the referrer's details during the App submission process, and the App must be approved within this timeframe for the referral to be valid.


## Referral Approval

Overwolf reserves the right to approve or reject referrals based on our evaluation of the submitted Apps and adherence to the program's rules and eligibility criteria. We will review each referral submission carefully and make a determination accordingly.

We hope that the Developer Referral Program encourages collaboration and growth within the Overwolf developer community. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact your DevRel manager or alternatively, reach out to us on developers@overwolf.com.

Thank you for your participation in the Overwolf Developer Referral Program, and we look forward to seeing the community thrive with your contributions!
