## About

This protocol is meant to serve as a standardized way of exposing game events from a game, for use in external apps.

Important specifications:
- The protocol operates over [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).
- All jsons sent must be encoded using [utf-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

:::note
It is recommended to use the [Game Events SDK](/topics/integrations/events-sdk-for-game-developers) where possible. This protocol is only intended to be used when using the SDK is not a viable solution.

## Navigation

Every version of the protocol is a complete definition on its own. As such, the [changelog](changelog) will document the exact changes between each version.

Versions will usually be backwards compatiable. However, for the cases that it is not possible to do so, certain versions will be marked as `longterm`. These versions will be considered stable and supported for a lot longer.
