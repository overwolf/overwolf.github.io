## Live Graph

Using the Graph, you can get an overview of the amount of User Logs uploaded every hour in the past 7 days.
Clicking on any one particular hour will filter the [User Logs Overview](#user-logs-overview) to that specific hour.

## User Logs Overview

In the following table, you can view all User Logs uploaded within the past 3 months, split into pages using
[The Paging Footer](/tools/developers-console#the-footer-toolbar).

For every User Logs file, you can then find the following fields:
- Name ([`file-prefix`](https://overwolf.github.io/api/utils#uploadclientlogsoptions-object) + `_generated-file-name`) - Name of this logs file.
- App Version - The version of the app from which this logs file was uploaded.
- Overwolf Version - The Overwolf Version from which this logs file was uploaded.
- Created - The date at which this logs file was uploaded.
- Username - The Overwolf username of the user that uploaded these logs. If the user was not logged in, this will equal to their [Overwolf Machine ID](http://localhost:3000/api/profile#note-userid-is-not-a-unique-identifier).
- Download button - Allows you to download the relevant logs file.

You can also sort the logs based on any of those fields, in either an Ascending or Descending order.

### Filtering

The displayed User Logs files can be filtered using the following:
- Start & End date - Define a date range from which to display logs.
- Today | Yesterday | 7D - Alternative way to define the date range, corresponding to "Current day", "Last day", and "Last 7 Days" respectively.
- Log name prefix - Filter by searching through the User Logs' [file prefix](https://overwolf.github.io/api/utils#uploadclientlogsoptions-object). This filter is applied upon clicking the Filter button.
