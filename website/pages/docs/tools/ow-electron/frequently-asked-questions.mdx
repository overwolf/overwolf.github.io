# Overwolf Electron FAQ

## Q: What is Overwolf Electron?
A: [Overwolf Electron](/tools/ow-electron) is a fork of the [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) project, complete with built-in
integration with several of Overwolf’s services.

<SkipMe>You can find an exact list of supported features [here](TODO).</SkipMe>

## Q: Why not use the Overwolf Platform?
A: The Overwolf Platform and the [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework are inherently and vastly different from each other.
Using the [Overwolf Electron](/tools/ow-electron) framework, we wish to bridge the gap between Overwolf’s services and apps that already utilize [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org).

## Q: Why Electron.js?
A: [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) is an incredibly popular and powerful framework, used by many large gaming desktop apps. It has cross-platform support,
as well as being part of the Node.js ecosystem, giving app creators even more flexibility with their development.

As such, it seemed like the natural choice as the next framework to join the Overwolf family.

## Q: Will this framework support Linux/Mac?
A: In future versions, we plan to support Mac builds, as well as some of the larger Linux distributions.

## Q: Why a fork? Why not use a module?
A: Overwolf’s services utilize many moving parts, including much of the underlying [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework,
as well as the underlying [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) APIs, and even some OS-level code. By using a forked version\* of [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/),
we can ensure that every build’s services will not just be much more stable, but also optimized, reliable, and seamless to integrate.

\**We ensure upstream compatibility for every build, making it possible to use both [ow-electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/ow-electron) and the corresponding [electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) build
side by side in the same project, while using the [electron-is-overwolf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/electron-is-overwolf) package to differentiate between the two.*

<SkipMe>You can learn more about using the two together [here](TODO)</SkipMe>

## Q: Why is it closed source?
A: [Overwolf Electron](/tools/ow-electron) utilizes several of our in-house, proprietary services. As such, in order to protect our IP,
it is impossible for us to make those services open source, which means that most [Overwolf Electron](/tools/ow-electron)’s changes themselves simply have to stay closed source.

However, where possible, we do plan to publish related/supplementary services as open source.
