## Technical Hunter

-   Your Main (index) window is used as a hidden controller that opens other windows.

-   Window management is done according to our best practices ([Read more here](/topics/using-windows-api/using-overwolf-windows#general-tips-for-using-windows)).

-   No in-game full screen windows are used.

-   All windows launch in up to 30ms ([Read more here](/topics/best-practices/launch-time-performance)).

-   Your app should have error notifications for network downtime, API issues and server errors. ([Read more here](/topics/best-practices/user-flow-and-error-handling)).

-   App follows local/server assets best practices. ([Read more here](/topics/best-practices/launch-time-performance)).

-   Avoid the use of non-100% transparency in your window design, calculating pixel values may cause a performance drop.

-   The app passed Overwolf's performance test. It works smoothly and does not cause lags in game. Moreover, the app has 0% GPU/CPU/memory usage when idle.
