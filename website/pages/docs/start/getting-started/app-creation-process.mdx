### 1. Pitch Your Concept

Once you're ready, talk to us about your app - starting is as easy as [submitting an app proposal](submit-app-proposal). We’ll take a look and share our feedback, thoughts and recommendations before you dive into development. If we're aligned and happy with the concept - we’ll provide you with everything you need to get your app out into our Appstore.

### 2. Build It - They Will Come

Concept approved? Let's go! Now it's time to start developing your app, and the real fun begins! 
Development can be challenging, but our product team is available for you to consult with in every step of the way. We will provide feedback for each feature and screen of your app, assist in getting extra resources or tools you might need, and make sure that other teams are aligned and ready to boost your app's success on release. 

### 3. Publish

After development is complete and you are happy with your app, you will officially become a part of the Overwolf pack! We’ll [publish your app](../submit-your-app) to the Overwolf Appstore, promote it online, and do our best to communicate its value to gamers everywhere. This is when you can start sharing your app with the world and engage some gamers!

### 4. Promote
While Overwolf promotes all apps in both the appstore and the desktop client, you can have many more gamers join your community by actively promoting the app over social media, Youtube, Twitch or other channels. If your app is stable and the main challenge now is getting it out there, talk to us and our marketing team will figure out the best ways to boost your signal and bring new users in.

## Updates and Maintenance

Getting your app in the Appstore isn’t the end of the road. Once your app is live, you’ll want to drive more users to check it out. It’s vital to fix bugs and sometimes add new features to your app, to keep it [up to date](../maintain-your-app/submit-an-app-update) and in demand.

We can’t wait to see the awesome, innovative and game-changing apps you have in mind. Good luck!
