### Prepare

The journey ahead may be long. As such, it's important to prepare first.  
We have compiled a short pre-flight check-list, to help you get your bearing:
- Do you have an idea?
- Is this an idea you can see, at least to a certain degree, a way to approach programatically?
  - It's impmortant to take time and research this part, especially for your idea's core parts!
- Take a look around this website - Can you spot the things you may need?
  - Specifically, did you take a look at [popular app features](/start/getting-started#what-can-apps-do)? Do any of these tie in to your design?
  - If your idea involves integration with real-time events in a specific game - Have you made sure that there are [events](/api/games/events) for that game, exposing the relevant data?

### Build

<SimpleTab groupId="frameworks" choices={
  {
    "overwolf-platform": "Was your initial submission approved? First of all, congratulations! Now you can start working with the API.",
    "electron-platform": ""
  }
}/>

Now, it's time to get started building your app. For now, don't aim for the sun. Instead, make sure you have the basics down:
- Experiment with the different [APIs](/api) you plan to use.
- Experiment with mockups of the different features you have planned.
- Read up on the other [APIs](/api) and [docs](/topics/best-practices) on this site.
- Try to create a minimal working version of your app.
- Make sure you have a basic plan of action from here on out.

#### Preparing the first app submission

Once you feel that you have created a simple, fully fledged version of your app, you may [submit][submit] it for initial review, or continue developing and improving it first.  
Once you do submit your first build, our team will then go over it, and let you know of any feedback they have.

After you take care of any serious issues the team might have found, you will receive access to the [Developer's Console](/tools/developers-console), where you may begin the [Releasing](#release) process.

### Release

So, you're ready to publish your app? That's great!  
_If you haven't already, please make sure to [submit][submit] your app for an initial review._

Once you have passed the basic submission process, you will also be assigned a DevRel manager. If you are ready to publish, simply let them know which version you wish to go public with.  
They will then pass it to the team for one final review cycle. Once all of (if any) the critical issues found are resolved, you will be able to ask your DevRel to publish your app to the store, for the whole world to see and use!

But remember, the journey doesn't end once you're ready to go live. In fact, this is merely the beginning of your app's [Growth](#grow)!

### Grow

Now that your app has is ready for release, there are many things you can do from here:
- Improve your app - More features, more improvements, better UX, better monetization, improved stability, better usability, the sky's the limit!
- Build and grow your community - You know what's better than one user? A whole community of users, all of which are invested in your app!
- Promote your app - No matter how great your app is, it would be sad if nobody knew about it. We can help you fix that, be it through planning and advice, or even [advertising it directly](/topics/request-a-service/promoting-your-app)!
