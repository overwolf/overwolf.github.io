## What can apps do?

If you can imagine it, you can probably make it!

However, to help you pick where to start, here are some of the most popular Overwolf app features to date:

- <h3>Game Stats</h3>
Highlight in-game stats, player intel, complete with live performance analyses, directly in the game, encouraging better tactics and smarter plays.
- <h3>Builds & Strategies</h3>
Provide recommendations for builds, loadouts, compositions, strategies, decks, and so much more, without ever leaving the game.
- <h3>Quality of Life</h3>
Go above and beyond, identifying and fixing unplanned friction points in the original games. Become the natural compliment to beloved titles.
- <h3>Highlights</h3>
Automatically clip highlights based on in game events such as kills or deaths, so gamers can always look back at the moments that truly mattered.
- <h3>3rd Party Integration</h3>
Integrate with any number of external services: Game forums, stream chats, even food ordering! The whole world, at your users' fingertips.

## Where do apps live?

Apps can run in several different environments, which you can always mix and match to create the perfect experience:

- <h3>In-Game Overlays</h3>
Using overlays, apps can extend a game's UI, create value in otherwise "dead" moments, or just generally work as seamless extensions of the game.
- <h3>Independent Desktop Windows</h3>
Apps can also provide native desktop windows, containing anything from game debriefing, performance analysis, highlights management, and much much more, running regardless of a game.
- <h3>Second Screen Views</h3>
As more and more gamers adopt setups with more than one screen, so can your app expand. Provide even better, more detailed functionality during the game, without hiding even a single extra in-game pixel.
