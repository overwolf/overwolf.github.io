:::tip About Ads
This page discusses the Overwolf Ads SDK and its specific implementation details.
If you haven't already, do also check out [**Working with Ads**][working-with-ads], for an overview
of what working with Ads entails on the app design level.
:::

The Overwolf Ads SDK is a JavaScript library that allows app developers to show Ads inside their applications.
Overwolf manages, filters, and hosts these ads, which are then served in the app through the SDK.

## Getting Started

:::info Ad Enablement
Ads will be served to your app only after Overwolf enables them for you.
To get started with implementing and enabling ads, please follow our [working with Ads][working-with-ads] guidelines.

Before Ads are enabled for your app, you still can (and should) test their behavior in your app.
You can find more details about using a placeholder Ad for testing [here](/start/test-your-app/how-to-test-your-app#ads).

## Guidelines for Ads integration

If you haven't already, please give a read to [Ad planning guidelines](working-with-ads#ad-planning-guidelines).

Apart from those, there are also certain things you should keep in mind when interacting with the actual Ad containers, on a more technical front:

- Your Ad container's minimum width and height should be >= The largest Ad container size selected for this container.
- Your Ad container element should have no child elements apart from the one generated by the SDK.
- Your Ad container should have a [placeholder background graphic](#ad-container-placeholders), to ensure that the container is never empty, even when no Ads are loaded.
- Your Ad container should ALWAYS be visible in the app screen.
  - _For specific cases where you wish to **temporarily** stop displaying Ads, you can set the `display` css property of the Ad's_
    _ container to `none`. This will stop the container from displaying Ads, until it is made to display again._
- If a window has multiple views, make sure its Ads containers do not change/refresh when moving between different menus/pages/views.
  - If you must specifically change these containers, **do not recycle them!** Instead, shut each changed container down, and open a new one in the new target location!
- Your Ad container should have no scrollbars, and should not be scrollable.
- Once a new OwAd object is created, you should **NEVER** modify any of its containers' CSS properties. The only property you **can** change is `display`, as mentioned in [bullet 4](#:~:text=For%20specific%20cases%20where%20you%20wish%20to%20temporarily%20stop%20displaying%20Ads).
- If you wish to **remove** an Ad container, **you must call `OwAd.shutdown()`!** This is usually done when:
  - You need to change the Ad container - Done by shutting down the current one, and then creating a new one with the new settings/location/parent.
  - You need to remove an Ad container - Done by just shutting down the current one.

<SkipMe type="TODO">
Fix link to "bullet 4", change this all to use numbers and potentially native highlights, and change numbering css
