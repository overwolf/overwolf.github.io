TL;DR:

- Every so often, Overwolf will start a new Direct Ads campaign. When this happens:
  - The campaign's details, terms, and comission will be published.
  - A set of URLs for assets will be provided.
  - A "target" URL will be provided.
- Apps wishing to participate will then display these assets, directing to the "target" URL on click.
  - The "target" URL MUST only be opened in the users' default browser.
  - The "target" URL MUST NOT open in a way that overtakes focus from an active game.
  - The "target" URL MUST only be opened if the user explicitly clicked on it.
- Ads displayed in this type of campaign will be in xxx*xxx size (don't remember what's the size)
- The assets will remain available until the campaign is ended, and will be removed afterwards.
- It is recommended to design this ad to pop up over the app's main window, greying out the app in the background.
- This ad type is designed to capture the attention of the player, being the reason for it's large size and position within the app. Also being the reason these types of ads can generate greater CPMs that can boost the app's revenue greatly.
- We recommend that App developers follow certain guidelines, to ensure the Ad does not become annoying/detrimental to user experience:
  - If showing a pop-up: 
    - Try to use dead moments in the App's lifetime.
    - Do not show it more than X times a day.
    - Do not show it more than Y times total.
    - Close the pop-up if the user clicks on a dedicated x button for it, OR clicks outside the pop-up in the App.
  - Only show high-engagement versions of the assets on desktop. *What does this mean?*
Below you can see a mock-up of such a campaign and how it would look like in an app:
