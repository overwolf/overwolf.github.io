The Overwolf recording APIs are directly based on the [OBS project](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio), integrating it into the relevant framework.  
As such, this page covers important OBS (also referred to as `Recording Engine`) terminology and settings, that are not strictly related to any specific API.
