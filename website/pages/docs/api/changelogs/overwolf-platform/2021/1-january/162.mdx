Note that iterations 160 to 162 were combined into a single iteration.  

### API

* Allow apps to add/remove their hotkeys right from the app (using a new API) without opening the OW client UI. You can assign only hotkeys that pre-defined in your manifest.
  * Use the new [overwolf.settings.hotkeys.assign()](/api/settings/hotkeys#assignhotkey-callback) and  [overwolf.settings.hotkeys.unassign()](/api/settings/hotkeys#unassignhotkey-callback) APIs.
* Reddit presents new required param for sharing: added a new share param called [Flair](/api/social/reddit#flair-object),  and a new function: [overwolf.social.reddit.getSubredditFlairs()](/api/social/reddit#getsubredditflairssubredditname-callback).
* Add to [GameInfoUpdatedEvent](/api/games#gameinfoupdatedevent-object):  
  * A new info change type: **gameOverlayChanged**.  Indicates if OW unable to hook input devices when hooking into a game.
  * If true, check if **overlayInputHookError** is true as well to identify that there is a hooking issue.
* Added a new API namespace: [overwolf.cryptography](/api/cryptography).
  * Currently supports two functions: *encryptForCurrentUser()* and *decryptForCurrentUser()*.
* Added [overwolf.games.inputTracking.init()](/api/games/input-tracking#initcallback) for using *getMousePosition* without pre-register to events.

### Platform
 
* Security patches:
  * Block browser from creating iframe to *extensions://*.
  * Block iframes inside apps from creating an iframe to *extensions://* - unless in externally_connectable
  * Block app windows that run in a remote address - from creating iframes to *extensions://* - unless in *externally_connectable*.
* Update to new OBS (141 with sdk 10.0.19041.1).
* Increase `localstorage` size to ~50MB. Note that localstorage should be used up to 20-25 MB saved data. If you need more than that, you should use other storage.
* Enable `navigator.storage.persist()` for *extension:\\* scheme.
