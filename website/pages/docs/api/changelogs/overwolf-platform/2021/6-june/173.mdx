* Note that iterations 171 to 173 were combined into a single iteration. 

### API

  * Manifest example: `"data": {"allowed_protocols": { "protocols": ["mailto", "steam"]}}`
  * 'file' in the scheme will always be blocked.
* Added `processId` to [overwolf.games.getRunningGameInfo](/api/games#getrunninggameinfocallback) and [overwolf.games.onGameInfoUpdated](/api/games#ongameinfoupdated).
* Coexistence API - Event to indicate if there is another overlay library running + if Overwolf doesn't manage to render anything, allow the app to give a relevant notification
  * Added a new object, [overwolf.games.OverlayInfo](/api/games#overlayinfo-object),  with info about the current out of process overlays.
  * Added a new [GameInfoChangeReason](/api/games#gameinfochangereason-enum) enum to the [overwolf.games.onGameInfoUpdated](/api/games#ongameinfoupdated) event,with some info about the hooking error reason. (if an hooking error has occurred).

  * New API: [overwolf.games.getLastRunningGameInfo()](/api/games##getlastrunninggameinfocallback) - returns the last played gameinfo (when no game is currently running). 
  * new API: [overwolf.settings.games.setAutoLaunchEnabled](/api/settings/games#setautolaunchenabledgameclassid-callback): allows apps to control what games they auto-launch for following user gesture (similar to performUpdate).

### Platform

* New client settings (Capture => Advanced Settings) with Rate Control and Max Kb/s sliders.
* Rebranding - we’re releasing almost all of Overwolf’s client modules with a new branding.

### Dev Console

* App Channels - a new feature that enables you to create and distribute different app versions for your users /testers. The first part of this feature [announced already on v0.170](#api-1), and now [the second](/tools/developers-console/all-applications/release-management) (and last) part is released - the app channels management tools from the dev console. 

### Bug fixes

* Extension tray icons would get blurry when changing display settings (try changing DPI from 100% to 175%).
* Replay API - TurnOffResult typo.
* [GameInfoUpdatedEvent](/api/games#gameinfoupdatedevent-object) Object - fixed the issue that runningChanged is not being updated once a game starts running.
* Fixed the issue that Video recording won't start if game is minimized.
* Fixed a bug where subs oneapp page sometimes won't open.
