* Note that iterations 182 to 184 were combined into a single iteration. 

### Docs

* A new I/O sample app in our [APIs sample apps repository](https://github.com/overwolf/apis-sample-apps). Demonstrates how to open and load a file to your app, Display it, Add some content, and Write it back to the file.
* As for now, the [basic sample](/start/basic-app/sample-app#docsNav) app was built only for Fortnite. In the new version of the sample app, we added support for 14 more games to ease your learning:
League of Legends, Valorant, Minecraft, CSGO, Escape From Tarkov, Overwatch, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Splitgate: Arena Warfare, Path of Exile, Dota 2, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Warframe.

### API

* Warframe game events support is back.
