### API

* Added support for file:// URI scheme in [overwolf.media.videoscreateVideoComposition()](/api/media/videos#createvideocompositionsourcevideourl-segments-callback).  
  Note that it only allows paths under the extension folder (`%localappdata%/overwolf/extensions/…`) or extension videos folder (`overwolf/videos/…`).

### Dev Console

* Added internal release notes to uploaded OPKs

### Bug fixes

* Fixed bug with OW overlay in Win 11:  
  Clicking an icon on the taskbar while in-game didn't shift the focus from the game to the window that opened. Instead, the window was left behind the game.
