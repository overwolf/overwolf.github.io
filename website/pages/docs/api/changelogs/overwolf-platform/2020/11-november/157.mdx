### API

* [overwolf.utils.openFilePicker](/api/utils#openfilepickerfilter-initialpath-callback) - now accepts multiple selection of files.  The selected files will be returned on the callback as an array.
* [overwolf.io.listenOnFile](/api/io#listenonfileid-path-option-callback) - add an indication that the watching on file started successfully.

### Platform

* Release phasing - keep the same distribution per release.  
  When you release version 1.0 to 10% of your users using the phase system and found a major bug - you can release an immediate fix 1.1 that targets the same 10% of your users.
* <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241" target="_blank">Aero-snap</a> support for native windows - Resizable native windows should support aero-snap (winkey + arrows and sticky-behaviour to screen edges).

### Bug Fixes

* Full-screen embedded videos no longer automatically repositioned in the top-left corner.
* Fixed an exception that could occur when shutting down Overwolf.
* Fixed a bug where the Windows 10 Controlled folder access prevented users from saving Overwolf videos in the default system directory.
* Rainbow 6: Siege - CPU usage no longer increases when the user Alt-Tabs to with Overwolf.
* Fixed several issues in Rainbow 6: Siege related to users who have enabled RawInput.
* Fixed an issue when using overwolf.extensions.relaunch too quickly.
* Several security patches for ransomware protection and processes protection.

### Dev Console

* We added a "per-version" retention report to compare retention between different app versions. You can see it on your board.

### Game Events

* We're expanding our library with typedef files for the different in-game events, starting with Valorant info updates.  You can find our def file in [this repo](https://github.com/overwolf/types), or as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/types).
