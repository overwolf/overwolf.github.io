### Docs
- Updated the documentation to reflect the new API changes listed below.
- Added documentation of the [`automation`](/start/getting-started/using-dev-tools#enabling-automation-testing-with-automation-flag) flag.

### API
- New API: A new and improved share method, giving feedback of upload progress (to allow for custom notification behaviour), and allowing cancellation of uploads midway, for all supported social media. To get started, check the relevant network's api documentation for the following methods by replacing * with the specific network you wish to work with (e.g. discord):
    * `overwolf.social.*.shareEx()`
    * `overwolf.social.*.cancelShare()`

  And the objects:
    * `overwolf.social.*.*ShareParameters` - Two new parameters: `id` and `useOverwolfNotifications` have been added for the new API.
    * `overwolf.social.*.SocialShareResult`
    * `overwolf.social.*.SocialShareProgress`

- New API: [`overwolf.utils.getClientInfo`](/api/utils) - a method for obtaining the Overwolf client's uptime, as well as install date.
- Updated API: [`overwolf.windows.onAltF4Blocked`](/api/windows) - is now invoked for all windows in the app as soon as it occursed on any window. Event result now also contains the name of the window that caused the invocation.


### Bug Fixes
- Overwolf windows no longer have visual artifacts when running Fortnite using DirectX 12 on AMD Graphics Cards.
