### API
- New API: [`overwolf.games.tracked.onUnsupportedExecuted`](/api/games/tracked#onunsupportedexecuted) - a listener function that will trigger when a process that is defined as "Unsupported" in the Gameslist launches. It's important to note that it will only trigger if the app has defined `"track_all_games":true` in the `manifest.json`.

### Platform
- New `manifest.json` flag:
  - `track_all_games` is a new optional manifest flag located under the [`launch_events`](/api/manifest#launch_event_settings-array) property, 
	 It can only be used in conjuction when the "tracked" property is set to true.
	 This flag will cause the app to launch whenever a process defined in the Gameslist launches, regardless of whether it has overlay support or not.

### Bug Fixes
- Hotkeys will now work on first launch when loading extension as unpacked.
- Fixed an issue with video composition if the file path has a quote ( ` ) char
- Fixed an out of memory issue when using our API to share large videos on YouTube.
- Fixed cases when calling `bringToFront` changes the window maximized state. 
- Resolved a case where we grabbed window focus upon creation of native windows, if the window was created as soon as a game was launched.
