### Documentation
Documentation changelogs have been moved to their own [feed](/api/changelogs/documentation/2023)!

### Platform
- [`overwolf.games.launchers.onUpdated`](/api/games/launchers#onupdatedcallback) now detects when the League of Legends launcher is minimized,
and will update its position to be -32,000 on both axes. Also applies to [`overwolf.games.launchers.getRunningLaunchersInfo()`](/api/games/launchers#getrunninglaunchersinfocallback).

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue on windows 11, where focusing a game with overlay enabled could block other windows from being focused.
- Custom app hotkeys will no longer be blocked when the app is not open.
