### API

* **Longer Replays** - The Replay API can now record up to 10 minutes unlike the
 3 minutes it was able to record before. Please use this wisely as it can affect
 memory usage, CPU and the time which it takes Overwolf to create the replay 
 video file.
* **getRunningGameInfo2** - _`getRunningGameInfo` is back and he's angrier than 
ever_ - In this sequel, `overwolf.games.getRunningGameInfo2` no longer returns 
just `null` when it's being called while there's no game running.
Now it returns: 
  ```JavaScript
    {
        gameInfo: null,
        success: true
    }
  ```
* **Media Folder Access** - `overwolf.media.videos` namespace now has access to 
previously chosen video folders (so if a user has changed the video folder, 
you'll now also have access to the previous folder when using that API).

### Platform

* **App Validations** - Each and every app that a user downloads now gets 
  validated to make sure it includes only the content the App Creator has 
  intended.
* **Updated 3rd party DLLs** - We updated most of our 3rd party DLLs, The
  following DLLs were updated to the following versions:
  ```text
  Newtonsoft.Json.dll - 13.0.1.25517
  CommandLine.dll - 2.8.0.0
  log4net.dll - 2.0.13.0
  Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll was replaced with DotNetZip.dll - 1.6.0.0
  ```
### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused an app window to become invisible after resizing.
* Fixed an issue that created an offset issue when using multiple monitors with
  different DPIs.
* Fixed a small memory leak with certain OpenGL games.
* Uninstalling multiple apps from the Overwolf Uninstaller while Overwolf is closed now works as intended.
* Fixed possible memory leak when using `overwolf.extensions.io.readTextFile` or `overwolf.extensions.io.writeTextFile` for extremely large files.
