Known website issues:
- "view all search results" is sometimes broken
- Changelog is not indexed when searching
- The old "Get It On Overwolf" images from the [Marketing Communication Guidelines](/topics/best-practices/communication-guidelines) page are unavailable from the old links. For now, the page has been updated with an extra set of links.

### Platform
- Added the `tray_icon` flag to the [manifest](/api/manifest). When provided, this icon will be used as the tray icon, rather than the launcher icon.
- Various improvements to high-dpi transparent windows.

- Fixed issue where [`overwolf.utils.openUriInDefaultBrowser('ms-settings:display-advancedgraphics')`](/api/utils#openurlindefaultbrowserurl) would not open the Microsoft Display settings.
- Fixed a bug involving [`overwolf.windows.flash()`](/api/windows#flashwindowid-behaviorcallback).
