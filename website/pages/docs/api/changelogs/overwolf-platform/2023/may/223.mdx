### Platform

### Bug Fixes

- Updating an app will no longer periodically log an exception to the Overwolf logs.
- Fixed a possible crash when opening a pop-up window within the app.
- Fixed an issue where an app couldn't re-subscribe to launcher events after being disabled and re-enabled while the launcher is open.
- Fixed an issue where Overwolf would sometimes crash on launch.
