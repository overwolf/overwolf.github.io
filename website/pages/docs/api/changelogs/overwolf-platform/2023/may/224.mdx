*As a part of this update, the recording API documentation is being rennovated. As such, some of these changes may not yet appear within their respective pages.*

### Platform

- Updated the underlying [OBS](/api/general/obs) recording engine version (27.2.3 -> 29.1.0). Notable changes include:
  - **Deprecated the `NVIDIA_NVENC` encoder**
  - Improvements to the `AMD_AMF` and `INTEL` (Quick Sync) video encoders
    - The new `AMD_AMF` implementation should run faster across the board, but may see a slight performance loss on considerably older hardware
    - The `INTEL` encoder has new encoder presets, which also cover the underlying OBS `target_usage` parameter.
  - Added three new `HEVC` encoders - `NVIDIA_NVENC_HEVC`, `INTEL_HEVC`, `AMD_AMF_HEVC`
    - These new encoders can only be used for local recordings, not for *live*streaming (not to be confused with the [streaming API](/api/streaming))
  - Various changes to the lists of supported video encoder presets - the full list can be found [here](/api/general/obs#encoders--presets-29.1.0)
    - Passing an invalid encoder preset will not throw an error, but instead use the default preset for that encoder. This also includes deprecated encoder presets
  - Microphones can now be set to record as [`mono`](/api/streaming#streamdevicevolume-object) rather than stereo.
  - Added support for the `encoder.config.profile` parameter from the underlying OBS, which accepts a value from the `overwolf.streaming.enums.StreamEncoderProfile` enum.
  - Added the `encoder_custom_parameters` field to the `extra_options` field, which allows you to pass encoder-related settings directly as is to the OBS engine,
    overriding any settings set by the Overwolf API. Documentation for finding the exact value names and values is currently in the works.
  - Removed error for using a wrong `encoder.config.preset` value. Any invalid preset passed in will now instead default to the encoder's default preset.
    - This also means that both `config.preset` and `config` are no longer required parameters when setting a specific encoder.
