### Platform
- Added support for remote disablement of Overlay for games where an issue may have popped up.
  - To simulate this behavior, two new Overwolf commandline flags have been added:
    - `--disable-overlay-test` - Disables all overlays for all games, regardless of client version.
    - `--disable-overlay-version="${VERSION_NUMBER}"` - If `VERSION_NUMBER` is higher than the current Overwolf Client version, disables all overlays for all games.  
      Example value: `--disable-overlay-version="0.235.0.0"`.
- Improved stability for loading OPK files, to account for interference from misconfigured Anti Viruses tampering with Apps.

### API
- New API - Added two new fields to `overlayInfo` ([overwolf.games.OverlayInfo](/api/games#overlayinfo-object)):
  - `overlayRemotelyDisabled` - Whether or not the Overlay for this game has been remotely disabled.
  - `minimumEnabledOverwolfVersion` - The minimum (if any) Overwolf version required to enable Overlay for this game.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed several issues/App crashes around edge-cases involving the Overlay.
