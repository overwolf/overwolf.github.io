:::warning Game State Integration
Due to a recent update in Dota 2 in order for Overwolf apps to work correctly you will need to inform your users to add under Launch Options the following command line: 
<br></br>-gamestateintegration - [More details here](https://support.overwolf.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000212745-how-to-enable-game-state-integration-for-dota-2)
In order to know which user is already using this command line parameter, you should use getGameInfo API, there you will get this parameter in the response under gameInfo --> GameInfo --> ProcessCommandLine - [More details here](.games)
