Every Overwolf application (ow-electron or Overwolf platform), has a unique app id. This unique id is automatically generated, and is based on the app's name,
and the app's author's name.

In ow-electron, these fields correspond to the following fields in the package.json file:
- App name - The `productName` or `name` properties
- App author - The `name` field under the `author` field.
