## Sample Apps
* [VALORANT game events sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/events-sample-apps)

## Available Features

* [gep_internal](#gep_internal)
* [me](#me)
* [game_info](#game_info)
* [match_info](#match_info)

## Game event status

It is highly recommended to communicate errors and warnings to app users. 

Check the current game event status [here](../status/all). Alternately, you can easily check that status from your app itself, [using our API](../topics/howto-check-events-status-from-app).

#### *player_name* note

Data Example:

```json
{"info":{"me":{"player_name":"Doom#5339"}},"feature":"me"}
```

#### *player_id* note

Data Example:

```json
{"info":{"me":{"player_id":"f4029eff-92e6-56db-adba-4d073df968a4"}},"feature":"me"}
```

#### *region* note

Data Example:

```json
{"info":{"me":{"region":"esp"}},"feature":"me"}
```

#### *agent* note

Not all agents have their game-name match their ID data, since this is an internal name, so take that into account.
Furthermore, if a character has an ability that gives him different points of view (f.ex Sova with his drone), the ID will change accordingly to the drone.

Data Example:

```json
{"info":{"me":{"agent":"Phoenix_PC_C"}},"feature":"me"}
```

Possible agent values:

* "Clay_PC_C" = Raze
* "Pandemic_PC_C" = Viper
* "Wraith_PC_C" = Omen
* "Hunter_PC_C" = Sova
* "Thorne_PC_C" = Sage

```

```

#### *round_phase* note

#### *team* note

#### *round_report* note

Data Example:

```json
{"info":{"match_info":{"round_report":"{"damage":331,"hit":6,"headshot":0,"final_headshot":1}"}},"feature":"match_info"}
```

#### *game_mode* note

Current values:

* Bomb = Regular game (Unrated).
* Quick Bomb = Spike Rush.
* Ranked = 1 = Competitive.
* Deathmatch = Deathmatch
* Escalation = Escalation

Both of these values also have "custom" value which is identified as a Boolean, either "True" or "False".<br>
True meaning that the current game is custom made, and false being an online game which is not custom.<br>
We recently added "ranked" value to game_mode which will indicate if the game you are playing is ranked or not. The values you will be getting range betweeb 0 which is received in the practice range, 1 which means it's a ranked game, and 2 which is received during Spike Rush and is just a random value, it does not represent a ranked game.

Data Example:

```json
{"info":{"match_info":{"game_mode":"{"mode":"bomb","custom":true,"ranked":"0"}"}},"feature":"match_info"}
{"info":{"match_info":{"game_mode":"{"mode":"bomb","custom":false,"ranked":"1"}"}},"feature":"match_info"}
{"info":{"match_info":{"game_mode":"{"mode":"deathmatch","custom":false,"ranked":"1"}"}},"feature":"match_info"}
```

#### *roster* note

<b>*Important:*</b> If players (or local player) in the match activate the option to hide their names from players outside their party, the output you will see will be the name of the agent (like `Jett` or in the case of the local player it will be `Me`) instead.
It is language dependant, so that is also important to take into account.

<b>*Important:*</b> Roster is not supported in game mode "escalation"
